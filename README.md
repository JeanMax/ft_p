TCP/IP Client/Server

### TODO: ###

* error handling (is_digit)
* server loose stdin reading after a client disconnection
* could be good to have two separates headers files...
* ^C on client should intercept current command... good luck bro -.-
* ls -Rla /  disconnect client :D (also print multi prompt...)
* if a line from client is interpreted as a command but isn't : free error party mix
